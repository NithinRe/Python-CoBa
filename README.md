# Python Complete Basics (PyCoBa)
These Modules are covered basic concepts in python, those who
know basic python syntax and has little knowledge about programming
they can understand easily.

PyCoBa can help you to learn all the modules in just 4 weeks.
Each module has four exercises, each exercise could take hardly 1-2 hours per day to complete. After completing PyCoBa, 
there are some other exercises available in my repository you can clone, download or fork on to your GitHub Profile.

If you want to all videos for this PyCoBa, I've learned it from udemy.
